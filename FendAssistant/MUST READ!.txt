This is Fend the virtual assistant!
He is a self learning AI. You get to teach him!
Other peoples experiance and memory can be given to him!
Just find someone else who uses him!

How to make sure it works:
Keep the FendAssistant folder on the desktop!
Leave the memory file in FendAssistant folder! Leave memory alone!
The main fender thing can be moved elsewhere but we prefer you make a 
shortcut to use.

Share what your fender learned!
We want fender to become smarter! And also this helps others learn to!
Go into your FendAssistant and grab the memory then bring to any website
for others to download! 

Use others knowledge with your Fender!
Download their memory and then open both yours & theirs so you
have two seprate screens, drag in stuff from theirs yours has not
yet learned so that way it will learn quicker and saves you time!
